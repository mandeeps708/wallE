* Auto wallpaper select after specified time (default 1 minute)
* Works for both gnome and non-gnome (openbox atleast) shells.
* What if feh is not installed?
* Make an installer script for creating the main script. That will include
  the prompt for time (or probably the directory).

* It may prompt user to select random wallpaper just for one time or make 
  it as a wallpaper changer startup script.
